# SpeedCalculation
calculate the speed of vehicle that we travel
In this project, we consider the problem of positioning, travel direction detection and speed estimation of GSM-based mobile phones. Many techniques are proposed using several technologies like GSM, UMTS or WiFi. Once these technologies are mature enough to be deployed, they will have significant impact on automotive telematics and modern public transit systems. We produce a technique for speed estimation and map matching using handover between Base Transceiver Stations (BTS). It could be applied in both network-based and terminalbased architectures. This work has been completely tested and analyzed in Egypt roads using realistic data and commercial android smart phone. In general, all performance evaluation results were good. Mean positioning error was 101 m, mean speed error was 3.9 kmlh and percentage of success map matched samples was 1000/0.
